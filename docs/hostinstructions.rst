Using G8 in Your Host
=====================

Ableton Live
------------
**MIDI**:

- Add an instance of G8 to an audio track that you want to apply gating to. 
- Create a MIDI clip with the pattern that you want to use for gating. 
- Click the “IO” symbol on the right side of the window to show the input/output section.
- Go to the MIDI track, and select the “MIDI To” dropdown, selecting your main audio track. 
- The subcategory dropdown menu right below this should now activate allowing you to select “1 G8 Gate.” Activating this setting will route the MIDI track into G8 so that you can use it to control the gate’s envelope. Make sure to set G8’s MIDI input note to whatever note is being used in your pattern.

**Sidechain Ins**:

- Add an instance of G8 to an audio track that you want to apply gating to. 
- Create a second audio track with the clip you want to use as a sidechain. 
- Click the “IO” symbol on the right side of the window to show the input/output section. 
- Go to the sidechain track, and select the “Audio To” dropdown, changing “Master” to your main audio track. 
- The subcategory dropdown menu right below this should now activate allowing you to select “3/4 G8 Gate.” Activating this setting will route the sidechain track into the third and fourth inputs on G8 so that you can use it to control the gate’s envelope.
