Introduction
============

G8 is a high-quality noise gate with many tricks up its sleeve, turning it into a creative effect in its own right as well as an overall dynamics workstation. Use it for quickly fixing noisy recordings or for finely controlled amplitude manipulation, ducking unwanted sounds while emphasizing what you want to hear. 

Flip mode and reject-output features allow you to use G8 as an “amplitude splitter” or a way of routing different volumed sections of a single track into different creative effects. This technique can be used to add interesting and unique non-linear (a.k.a. amplitude-dependent) effects such as compound distortions, delays, reverbs, and EQ- each of which once set up, can be tweaked and modulated simply through changing a single threshold knob. Cycle and single-shot envelope gating modes allow you to easily create intricate amplitude triggered stutter effects- which are especially powerful when combined with G8’s fully supported MIDI input and output triggers.  

Use it for noise removal, transient shaping, amplitude-dependent effects routing, glitchy rhythms, and much more. A large number of presets will get you started!

Gating is an effect commonly used to reduce audio noise by only allowing signals over a certain amplitude threshold to pass. Generally, this is used to eliminate unwanted noise from tracks, but it can also be used for exaggerated stuttering rhythms and all sorts of other creative dynamic effects.


Features
--------
- “Cycle” and “One-shot” gating modes, allowing you to use G8 as a stutter effect, granular synth, or triggerable envelope. 
- Sidechain support
- Independent Analysis Gain and Output Gain controls
- RMS and Peak style metering
- Lookahead 
- Wet/Dry knob for parallel gating or expansion
- Reduction setting which can be used to limit the harshness of the gate
- Hysteresis and Hold parameters to prevent “chatter” 
- Customizable MIDI input and output
- “Reject” outputs. These follow the opposite gating envelope as the output, allowing you to use G8 as a two-band amplitude splitter!
- Flip mode, which reverses G8’s threshold analysis behavior
- Expert Mode featuring an advanced routing, amplitude, and filtering matrix for each channel, as well as individual input monitors for up to 4 channels
