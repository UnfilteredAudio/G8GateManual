Additional Features and Modes
=============================

Reject Outputs
--------------

One of G8’s most innovative features is its ability to create “Reject Outputs” when used in four-channel mode. The Reject Outputs are a set of auxiliary outputs that output the sound that is currently being blocked by the gate. If this is hard to conceptualize, mixing together the gated signal and the Reject Outputs will give you back your original signal.

This opens up all sorts of creative mixing possibilities using a technique that we call “amplitude splitting”. This allows you to create non-linear (amplitude dependent) effect chains using any other plug-in you wish.
For a simple example, you could create an amplitude dependent auto-panner. Simply mix the main outs down to one channel, and the Reject Outputs down to another. If you are creating a four-channel mix, this is an easy and flexible surround auto-panner!

For more information on how to connect the Reject Outputs in your DAW, please refer to the section “Using G8’s Sidechain Inputs and Reject Outputs”. If your host doesn’t support G8’s four-channel layout, then please refer to the next section on using the “Flip Mode”.


Flip Mode
---------

When “Flip Mode” is active, the main outputs and the Reject Outputs are swapped. This is useful for a number of reasons. First, if your host does not support G8’s four-channel mode, then this will still give you access to G8’s Reject Outputs. Second, this mode is visible to automation! This allows you to increase the complexity of your Reject Output effect chains by switching between the two modes. Third, it allows you to simply use the Reject Outputs if you have no use for the main outputs.

Why would you want access to only the Reject Outputs? Well, one of our favorite uses of the Flip Mode is to use G8 as a bizarre compressor! To achieve this, activate Flip Mode, and then change the amount of reduction that G8 is using. There are many other wild effects waiting to be discovered in this mode, especially in combination with G8’s alternate behaviors.


Expert Mode
-----------

Expert Mode is an optional mode that provides more in-depth control for advanced analysis situations. In this mode, you have access to the gain of each individual channel, along with the ability to filter the analysis signal. You also have the ability to change between different modes of analysis.

To get you started, here are some ideas for how to use Expert Mode:

- Use the filters to remove noise from your analysis signal. You can remove clicks and pops from your analysis signal to make sure that they don’t open the gate at the wrong moments.
- Control an uneven stereo signal by applying separate gain to each channel or setting Analysis Mode to “Average”.
- Create a mix of your main input and external sidechain input. Balance these correctly to create unusual gating polyrhythms.
- For even more unusual gating behavior, change the analysis mode to “Average” and use two very different input sources.
